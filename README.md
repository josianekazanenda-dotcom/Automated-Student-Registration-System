# Automated-Student-Registration-System
## Design a pure Python program that accepts a student’s last and first names and generates a unique registration number using:
• first three consonants of the last name (uppercase; pad with X if needed),
• first three letters of the first name (uppercase; pad with X if needed),
• three-digit sequential counter for students sharing the same prefix (001, 002, ...).
The program must normalize accented characters, ignore spaces and hyphens, validate
input characters, and track previously generated prefixes during execution.
